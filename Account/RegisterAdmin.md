# Monkey Authentication – Admin Registration Page Guide

## Purpose
This page is used for registering a new administrator account on the Monkey Authentication platform. It provides a simple interface for creating an admin user with access privileges.

## Steps to Register an Admin Account

1. **Open the Registration Page**
   - Visit the URL above in your web browser.

2. **Agree to Terms**
   - Before proceeding, you must check the box labeled **"I agree to the terms"**. Registration cannot proceed unless this box is selected.

3. **Click Register**
   - Once you agree to the terms, click the **"Register"** button to submit the form.
   - If the form is incomplete or incorrect, an error message will appear indicating what needs to be fixed.

## Error Handling

- **Blank Fields**: If required inputs are not filled in (depending on implementation), an error will appear.
- **Unchecked Agreement**: Failing to check the “I agree to the terms” box will prevent form submission.

## Best Practices

- **Read Terms Carefully**: Understand the service terms before agreeing.
- **Use a Secure Connection**: Ensure you're on a secure network when registering an admin account.
